        question: "Can I watch movies and shows on CineScope?",
        answer:
          "CineScope does not stream titles directly. We help you decide what is worth your time with fast details like synopsis, cast, and community score, then you can watch on your preferred service.",
      },

        id: "collections",
        question: "What are Collections and how do they work?",
        answer:
          "Collections are your personal shelves. Group titles by mood, theme, or anything you want, like Sunday comfort movies, date night picks, or sci fi deep cuts. Add titles from the card menu and keep your favorites organized.",

      {
        id: "missing",
        question: "Why is a title missing, or why is the info incomplete?",
        answer:
          "Sometimes a title is not available yet, has limited metadata, or is listed differently depending on region and source data. If a poster, synopsis, or cast looks incomplete, it usually means the source has not published it yet.",

        id: "privacy",
        question: "Does CineScope track me?",

        id: "feedback",
        question: "How can I request a feature or report a bug?",

          "If something feels off, tell us what you clicked and what you expected to happen. Screenshots help, but a quick description works too. We build CineScope in iterations, so feedback directly shapes what gets improved next.",
